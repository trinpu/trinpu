# 👋🏾 Hi, I'm Pierre

I'm a Technical Program Manager by day and a computational artist by night. In my day job, I drive strategic outcomes through technical innovation. Lately, I've been working on building and implementing AI agents to enhance localization workflows. As a computational artist, I combine creativity and computation to create new immersive experiences and art pieces.

### My primary areas of interest are:

* AI Agents
* Immersive installations
* Sound synthesis
