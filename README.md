## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Pierre. I'm a former Olympic athlete and product manager. Currently, I'm an aspiring creative technologist and computational artist. This means that I combine my passion for creativity and computation to build AR or immersive exeperiences, synthesize sounds or generate images. My primary areas of interest are:

* AR experiences
* Immersive installations
* Sound synthesis and generative composition
* Transfiguration - as a Harry Potter fan, I like to transform one object into another (digital or physiscal)
